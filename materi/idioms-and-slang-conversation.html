<h2>IDIOMS AND SLANG EXPRESSIONS CONVERSATION</h2>

  <p>Welcome to the “Idioms and Slang Expressions” section</p>

  <p>In learning English, it is essential not only to understand grammar rules and formal vocabulary, but also to become familiar with expressions commonly used in daily conversations by native speakers. Two of the most widely used informal expressions are idioms and slang.</p>

  <p>In this section, you will explore a variety of commonly used idioms and slang expressions, complete with meanings, example sentences, and video references to help you understand how they are used in context.</p>

  <h3>Idioms</h3>

  <p>An idiom is a group of words whose meaning is different from the literal meaning of the individual words. Idioms are commonly used in everyday English to express ideas in a more colourful or imaginative way.</p>

  <h3>Slang Expressions</h3>

  <p>Slang refers to informal words or expressions that are commonly used in casual conversations and are popular among young people or specific communities. Using slang can make our English sound more relaxed and natural, but we still need to understand the context of when it’s appropriate or not to use it!</p>

Lisa	: “Hey, Tata! How’s the group project going? You seemed a bit stressed last time.”
Tata	: “Ugh, don’t even get me started. I feel like I’m carrying the team on my back.” 
(carrying the team on my back = melakukan hampir semua pekerjaan sendiri dalam satu tim)
Lisa	: “Yikes! So they’re not helping?”
Ayu	: “Not really. I tried to break the ice in our group chat, but no one responded.”
(break the ice = memulai percakapan untuk mencairkan suasana)
Lisa	: “That’s rough. Maybe they’ll come around at the eleventh hour.”
(at the eleventh hour = di detik-detik terakhir / menjelang tenggat waktu)
Ayu	: “Hopefully. But I’m not holding my breath. I’m just gonna bite the bullet and finish most of it myself.” 
(bite the bullet = memaksakan diri melakukan sesuatu yang tidak menyenangkan tapi perlu dilakukan)
Lisa	: “Wow. You’re really going the extra mile. I admire your dedication!”
(going the extra mile = melakukan usaha lebih dari yang diharapkan)

Ayu		: “Girl, you're wild. I wish I had your chill vibes." 
(wild = gila tapi keren / spontan banget; chill vibes = suasana santai, sikap tenang)
Rani	: “Well, fake it till you make it, right?"
(fake it till you make it = pura-pura percaya diri sampai akhirnya benar-benar bisa)
Ayu		: “True that! Anyway, wanna grab some boba later?"
