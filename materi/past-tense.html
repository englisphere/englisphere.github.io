 <h2>Past Tenses in English</h2>

    <h3>1. Learning Material</h3>
    <p>In English, there are several forms of past tenses. Each one gives a different nuance about the timing, completion, and connection of past events.</p>

    <h4>Types of Past Tenses</h4>
    <table border="1">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Tense</th><th>Structure</th><th>Usage</th><th>Example</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Past Simple</td><td>Subject + V2</td><td>Completed actions at a specific time in the past.</td><td>"She visited Paris last year."</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Past Continuous</td><td>Subject + was/were + V-ing</td><td>Ongoing action in the past, often interrupted.</td><td>"They were watching TV when I called."</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Past Perfect</td><td>Subject + had + V3</td><td>Action completed before another past action.</td><td>"She had finished dinner before he arrived."</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Past Perfect Continuous</td><td>Subject + had been + V-ing</td><td>Ongoing action that was happening before another action or time in the past.</td><td>"He had been studying for three hours when the phone rang."</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>Key Points</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Past Simple</strong> = finished actions ("I walked to school.")</li>
      <li><strong>Past Continuous</strong> = background action ("I was walking when it started to rain.")</li>
      <li><strong>Past Perfect</strong> = action completed before another ("I had walked before it rained.")</li>
      <li><strong>Past Perfect Continuous</strong> = ongoing action that had duration ("I had been walking for hours.")</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Signal Words</h4>
    <p>Certain words often hint at which tense you should use:</p>
    <table border="1">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Signal Word</th><th>Likely Tense</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Yesterday, Last week, In 1990</td><td>Past Simple</td></tr>
        <tr><td>While, When, As</td><td>Past Continuous</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Before, After, Already, By the time</td><td>Past Perfect</td></tr>
        <tr><td>For, Since, Before (with duration)</td><td>Past Perfect Continuous</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
